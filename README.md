# Crossword GUI
For my senior design project, I was recruited by the Micron Global Quality Assurance Department to assist with the creation of a custom crossword puzzle webApp to be used as a fun learning tool for employees. As part of a team of 5, I was tasked with designing & developing the front-end for the app. This code was later converted to Angluar by another team member and incorporated into the app.

## Features
- Automatic word/direction highlighting
- Dynamically generated board from list of words/hints/positions
- Clearing incorrect tiles or entire board 
- Automatic game pause & window blur when tab is no longer focused
